     - --amend → edit the last commit (message and/or content)

2. git branch
   - Lists, creates, or deletes branches.
   - Arguments:
     - (no args) → list local branches
     - -a → list all branches (local + remote)
     - <branch-name> → create a new branch
     - -d <branch-name> → delete a branch safely
     - -D <branch-name> → force delete a branch
     - -vv → show local branches with their tracking remotes

3. git checkout
   - Switches to a branch or restores files.
   - Arguments:
     - <branch-name> → switch to a branch
     - -b <new-branch> → create and switch to a new branch
     - <commit-hash> → check out a specific commit (detached HEAD)

4. git pull
   - Updates the current branch by fetching from a remote and then merging (or rebasing).
   - Arguments:
     - (no args) → fetch and merge from the tracked remote branch
     - <remote> <branch> → pull a specific branch from a remote
     - --rebase → rebase instead of merge after fetching

5. git push
   - Sends local commits to a remote repository.
   - Arguments:
     - (no args) → push current branch to its upstream remote
     - <remote> <branch> → push a branch explicitly
     - -u <remote> <branch> → set upstream for future pushes/pulls
     - --force / -f → force push (overwrites history on remote)
     - --tags → push all local tags to remote

6. git merge
   - Combines commits from another branch into the current branch.
   - Arguments:
     - <branch> → merge the given branch into the current one
     - --no-ff → always create a merge commit, even if fast-forward is possible
     - --abort → stop and revert an in-progress merge

7. git rebase
   - Re-applies commits from your branch onto another branch (rewrites history).
   - Arguments:
     - <branch> → rebase current branch on top of the given branch
     - -i <commit> → interactive rebase (reorder, squash, edit commits)
     - --abort → stop and revert an in-progress rebase
     - --continue → continue after resolving conflicts

8. git fetch
   - Downloads objects and refs from a remote, but does not merge them.
   - Arguments:
     - (no args) → fetch all branches from the default remote
     - <remote> → fetch from a specific remote
     - <remote> <branch> → fetch only a specific branch
     - --all → fetch all remotes
     - --prune → remove remote-trackin
